# An online repository for Corey's screenplays

### [Better Fountain](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piersdeseilligny.betterfountain) VS Code extension + Github = Free cloud based screenwriting software!

#### I also use my custom nord-based theme [nord-fountain]( https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=internet-corey.nord-fountain) in conjunction with [Theme by Language](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsaulou.theme-by-language) so the text isn't multi-colored.

.fountain language settings in vscode settings.json:
```
"[fountain]": {
  "editor.wordWrap": "on",
  "editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "other": false,
    "comments": false,
    "strings": false
  },
  "editor.lineNumbers": "off",
  "editor.folding": true,
  "editor.glyphMargin": true,
  "editor.rulers": [],
},
```
